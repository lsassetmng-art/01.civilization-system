# PERSONA BUILDER IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

status: implementation-ready-followup

order:
1. draft persistence
2. draft read/update api
3. section change and conflict control
4. validation result persistence
5. approval request flow
6. publish request flow
7. release cut / snapshot handoff
8. apply result feedback connection
9. builder acceptance and regression tests

# EXACT READY DEVELOPMENT REINFORCEMENT

status_extension: author-reviewed-with-development-reinforcement
reinforced_at: 20260417_150811
reinforcement_scope:
- implementation order clarification
- acceptance target clarification
- guardrail clarification
- rollback or recovery clarification where applicable

domain: builder

minimum_development_requirements:
- define recommended implementation sequence
- define dependencies that must be fixed before coding
- define minimum acceptance checks
- define regression-sensitive areas
- define audit and observability checks where applicable

mandatory_guardrails:
- no coding before contract boundary is explicit
- no mutable side-effect without audit evidence
- no retry path without stop condition
- no release-sensitive path without gate verification
- no test completion claim without reject-path checks

minimum_acceptance_targets:
- success path proof
- reject or block path proof
- persistence effect proof where applicable
- audit evidence proof
- retry or recovery proof where applicable

development_ready_note:
This reinforcement does not replace the authored development content above.
It marks the minimum exact-ready development items that must be explicit
before implementation planning is considered complete.
