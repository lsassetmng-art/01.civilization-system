# PERSONA SNAPSHOT DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

status: implementation-ready-followup

snapshot_rules:
- issued from a known draft version
- content hash fixed at issuance
- immutable after issuance
- lineage to source draft and publish request must remain queryable

required_tests:
- same draft content produces deterministic hash
- changed draft content produces changed snapshot hash
- issued snapshot cannot be mutated in place

# EXACT READY DEVELOPMENT REINFORCEMENT

status_extension: author-reviewed-with-development-reinforcement
reinforced_at: 20260417_150811
reinforcement_scope:
- implementation order clarification
- acceptance target clarification
- guardrail clarification
- rollback or recovery clarification where applicable

domain: snapshot

minimum_development_requirements:
- define recommended implementation sequence
- define dependencies that must be fixed before coding
- define minimum acceptance checks
- define regression-sensitive areas
- define audit and observability checks where applicable

mandatory_guardrails:
- no coding before contract boundary is explicit
- no mutable side-effect without audit evidence
- no retry path without stop condition
- no release-sensitive path without gate verification
- no test completion claim without reject-path checks

minimum_acceptance_targets:
- success path proof
- reject or block path proof
- persistence effect proof where applicable
- audit evidence proof
- retry or recovery proof where applicable

development_ready_note:
This reinforcement does not replace the authored development content above.
It marks the minimum exact-ready development items that must be explicit
before implementation planning is considered complete.
