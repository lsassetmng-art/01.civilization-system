## COMMON OS NON-GOALS

This directory must stay aligned with the app_common boundary rule:
- shared mutable metadata may be modeled or referenced
- business canon remains domain-owned
- secrets must not be stored here

## ERP RELATION
This directory may support ERP shared UI applicability where relevant,
but it must not absorb ERP business canon.

## OFFLINE-FIRST RELATION

## INTERPRETATION RULE
CommonOS standardizes shared UI and shared metadata direction.
It must not become a dumping ground for unrelated domain-specific logic.
