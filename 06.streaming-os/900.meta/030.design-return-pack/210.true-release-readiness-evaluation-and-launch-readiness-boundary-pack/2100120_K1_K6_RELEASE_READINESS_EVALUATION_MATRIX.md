  - performer assignment invariants still preserved
  - continuity/local-state invariants still preserved
- must_not_emerge:

  - alert/inbox operational invariants still preserved
- must_not_emerge:
  - moderation-owned persona internal truth

K5_corporate:
- evaluation_focus:
  - oversight/affiliation/reference invariants still preserved
  - governance reference reading still preserved
- must_not_emerge:
  - company-local persona canonical

K6_monetization_reaction_ranking_ad:

  - snapshot/result-ref interpretation still preserved
- must_not_emerge:
  - persona emotional/profile canonical duplication

global_rule:
True release-readiness may only be judged when all six domains preserve
their approved invariant meaning together.
