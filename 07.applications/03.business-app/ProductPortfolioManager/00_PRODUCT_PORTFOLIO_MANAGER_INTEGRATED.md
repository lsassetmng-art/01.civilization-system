integrated_entry_point_purpose:
This file is the canonical top-level navigation entry
for the ProductPortfolioManager design set.

design_identity:
ProductPortfolioManager is a lightweight product strategy judgment application.
It sits on top of ERP facts,
uses forecast as advisory reference,
and governs portfolio-scoped artifacts such as
scores, classifications, proposals, reviews, approvals, alerts, and audit history.

global_requirements:
- multilingual support
- multi-currency support
- iphone support
- android support
- pc support
- tablet support

core_judgment_loop:
- onboarding
- fact reference
- evaluation refresh
- classification review
- proposal
- review
- approval
- audit preservation

layer_summary:

  010.constitution:
    role:
      Defines meaning boundaries, including classification, lifecycle, proposal, ERP boundary, and forecast boundary.

  020.architecture:
    role:
      Defines major surfaces and domain structure, including dashboard, list, comparison, detail, review, proposal, KPI/scoring, and boundaries.

  030.model:
    role:
      Defines portfolio entities, exact tables/enums, relation semantics, API mapping, and preset/settings semantics.

  040.runtime:
    role:
      Defines runtime behavior for score refresh, classification state handling, and review/approval progression.

  050.flow:
    role:
      Defines business flow, exact payload flow, and formal operator flows across major surfaces.

  060.integration:
    role:
      Defines ERP and forecast reference integration boundaries and source-attributed data handling.

  070.operations:
    role:
      Defines cadence, alert/notification handling, review operations, audit/history operations, freshness-by-surface, and recipient-resolution operations.

  080.policy:
    role:
      Defines interpretation rules across classification, approval, localization, currency, share, audit, scoring, lifecycle, proposal, ERP, forecast, presets, freshness, and notification recipients.

  100.security:
    role:
      Defines access, authorization, share security, audit-history security, and notification-recipient security.

  110.infrastructure:
    role:
      Defines infrastructure shape for persistence, gateways, and draft/sync support.

  120.implementation:
    role:
      Defines non-code implementation requirements, API contracts, screen/API mappings, screen-level requirements, freshness rules, and recipient-resolution requirements.

  130.development:
    role:
      Defines phase plan and development guardrails.

  900.meta:
    role:
      Defines progress tracking, restart support, wide-index reflection, compression guidance, copy blocks, closure note, handoff bundle, reflection planning, patch proposals, draft review assets, implementation-preparation notes, implementation phase opening notes, and phase 1 start-order assets.

current_closure_note:
The design set is broad across constitution, architecture, model, flow,
integration, operations, policy, security, and implementation requirements.
Phase 1 start order is now fixed.
Actual coding remains a later explicit step.

next_natural_topics:
- explicit Phase 1 coding start
- or stop here until coding phase opens
